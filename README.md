## 🎓 Portfolio Context

This project showcases my journey from basic web development to implementing enterprise-grade patterns. Starting as a simple calendar for a code assessment, I continued to develop it extensively to gain full knowledge of the .NET backend ecosystem and deployment cycle, while also transitioning to React from what I had previously been using in work. This transformation demonstrates:

- **Backend Excellence**: Clean architecture with FastEndpoints, comprehensive middleware, and thread-safe operations
- **Modern Frontend**: React with advanced state management, error handling, and performance optimization
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Seamless API communication with resilience patterns
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed real-world challenges like rate limiting and infinite loops
- **Best Practices**: Clean code, comprehensive testing, and documentation
- **Continuous Learning**: Self-driven exploration of .NET Core and React best practices beyond the initial requirements

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

While the application is fully functional, potential improvements include:
- TypeScript migration for enhanced type safety
- GraphQL API implementation
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Multi-user support with authentication
